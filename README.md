This is my third project here and I enjoy it a lot. I had no problems in this
project but at the end when i tried to do hover effects I had no problem with text
but I couldn't pull of the image hover, because when I tried it i searched a lot
about image hovers but I just couldn't implement it into my project here. The view eye was always not opacity 1 when background had to be opacity less than 1 and I couldnt use it only on the image so I had to do another container which I could size properly to the image. I would really like to know how to handle it if someone knows.
Any type of critique is appreciated. Thank you :)
